# BankingInterestApp

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
  This project's goal was to create a program that displayed compound intreset based off the input the user gave over a certain time frame.
  
What did you do particularly well:
  I created this program very efficiently and cleanly. I made sure my code was easier to read along with comments describing what each portion of the code's purpose was. 

Where could you enhance your code: How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could enhance my code by making the project more user friendly by creating a interface for the user to use, unlike what I have which just uses the console to display input and output. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this: What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part of this code was making the numbers compounded monthly versus yearly. The two give completely different results. I overcame this by running multiple loops which ran through each month of each year. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work:
  The skill of working with numbers and compound interest could be very useful in the future especially if working for a banking company. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable:
  I made my project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making sure every single case was accounted for. I made it readable specifically by leaving the key at the bottom of each file explaining the naming conventions for this project.
